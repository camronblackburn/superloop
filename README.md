# SuperLoop: Timeloop+Accelergy for superconducting electronics

SuperLoop is  an extension of the [Timeloop+Accelergy](https://timeloop.csail.mit.edu/) accelerator modeling framework, to explore the superconducting electronics design space for deep learning accelerators.

This repo contains a library of superconducting circuit components to enable full-stack modeling with the Timeloop+Accelergy infrastructure, along with examples and documentation on how to use it. Everything is accessible withe the Docker container, in the workspace directory.
